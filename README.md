## üìã Description

This script uses Node.js and the `axios` library to automate interactions with the Comedy Defensive Driving website. It allows users to automate certain processes on the site using session cookies and screen IDs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** installed on your system.
2. **Install `axios` and `qs` libraries**:

    NPM
    ```bash
    npm i axios qs
    ```
    YARN
   ```bash
    yarn add axios qs
    ```
3. **Valid session cookies** from the Comedy Defensive Driving website.

## üß© How It Works

1. **Cookies and Headers:**  
   The script requires valid session cookies to authenticate requests to the website. These cookies should be obtained from your browser session and inserted into the script.
   
 2.  #### The __Cookie__ data can be found by following these steps:
       - Go to the Network tab.
       - Refresh the page.
       - Find `dashboard.php` in the list of network requests.
       - Right click on `dashboard.php`.
       - Hover over the `copy` option, and click `Copy as fetch (Node.js)`.
       - Enter the cookie string into the script.


3. **Screen ID:**  
   The `screenID` parameter is required for the POST request to the `dashboard.php` endpoint. This value changes after each exam and verification question. To get the latest `screenID`, follow these steps:
   - Open the browser's Inspect tool.
   - Go to the Network tab.
   - Refresh the page.
   - Find `dashboard.php` in the list of network requests.
   - Click on `dashboard.php` and go to the Payload tab.
   - Copy the `screenID` value.

4. **POST Request:**  
   The script sends a POST request to the `dashboard.php` endpoint with the necessary data and headers to simulate interactions with the website.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Script Setup

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.js` file and fill in the required cookie value and screen ID.
    ```javascript
    // Cookie contents # dont change after setting
    const cookie = `your_cookie_content`;
    ```

3. Replace the placeholder `screenID` with the actual value.
    ```javascript
    const data = qs.stringify({ screenID: 'your_screen_id', formType: 'video' });
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Script

To run the script, use the following command:
```bash
node index.js
```
